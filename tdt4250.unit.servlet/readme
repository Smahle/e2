tdt4250.unit.api:
	-Unit: interface for what all units contains
	-UnitConverter: method for converting from one unit to another
	-UnitConversionResult: results contains a node and a boolean saying if they are valid or not
	
tdt4250.unit.gogo.Gogos: contains method for adding new conversions for existing units in gogo shell

tdt4250.unit.meter.Meter: existing unit implementing Unit
tdt4250.unit.newton.Newton: existing unit implementing Unit

tdt4250.unit.servlet.Servlet: component that handles the input in browser and output

tdt4250.unit.util.UnitUtil: used to create new unit conversions in gogo shell


Launch:

open launch.bndrun and press "Run OSGi". Enter "http://localhost:8080/convert?q=np1234" in browser. The first letter after the '=' is the
start unit, the second letter is the end unit, and the number behind is the value.

To add another unit before running: press new->Bnd OSGi Project->and choose template "Component development". Add build dependencies in bnd.bnd to
tdt4250.unit.api and tdt4250.unit.util and add the new project to run dependencies in launch.bndrun in tdt4250.unit.servlet. Remember to clean and rebuild.

To add another unit in gogo (runtime), enter in the console: g! add "x=m*0.0001". The end unit is first, then after '=' is the start unit (which
must exist) and the number after '*' is the factor.
